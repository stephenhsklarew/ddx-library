# Product Requirements Document Creation

Help create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) that aligns stakeholders and drives successful product development.

## Information Gathering

I'll help you build a complete PRD by gathering information in these areas:

### 1. Product Foundation
- Product name, type, and brief description
- Vision statement (3-5 year aspiration)
- Core problem being solved
- Unique value proposition

### 2. Users and Market
- Primary and secondary users
- User personas with goals and pain points
- Primary and secondary use cases
- Market segments

### 3. Requirements
**Functional** (prioritized as Must-Have, Should-Have, Nice-to-Have):
- Feature name, description, user benefit
- Acceptance criteria

**Non-Functional**:
- Performance (response time, throughput, availability)
- Security (auth, data protection, compliance)
- Usability (accessibility, device support, localization)
- Scalability (growth projections, architecture)

### 4. Success Metrics
- Business metrics (revenue, acquisition, retention)
- Product metrics (adoption, engagement, satisfaction)
- Technical metrics (performance, reliability, quality)

### 5. Constraints and Risks
- Technical and business constraints
- Assumptions
- Risk assessment with mitigation strategies

### 6. Timeline
- Development phases
- Key milestones
- Release strategy

Let's start: **What is the product name and what problem does it solve?**
